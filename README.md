# URBAN-HEAT-ISLAND-ANALYSIS-SALEM
# Follwing Objectives-
1. To derive Land Surface Temperature (LST) from the Landsat imagery. 
2. Mapping of Urban heat island (UHI) and Urban Hot Spot (UHS). 
3. ToÂ compute indices: Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI), Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), Normalized difference bareness index (NDBaI), and 
   Modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI).
4. To analyze the correlation between LST, UHI, UHS, and the indices to deduce the potential influencers.
